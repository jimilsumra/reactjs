What is localhost & localhost IP?

Localhost: localhost is the computer that we are using. Localhost allows us to test, debug or build apps & websites. While working
on the localhost, it doesn't required the internet connection. 

Localhost IP address is typically like 127.0.0.1. This is called loopback address. This means when we request anything to 
to this IP address then it will direct back to same device and not send any requests to the remote server or network.
