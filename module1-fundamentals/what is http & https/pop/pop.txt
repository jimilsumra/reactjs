What is POP?

Def: POP means Post Office Protocol. This is the standard protocol email clients use to receive emails from a mail server. We can
Download the email using this protocol to access the emails from the server and send them to their local machine for offline access. 

For example, the Outlook app uses POP to download emails to the local machine, which can be useful to access emails offline.
