What is MIME?

Def: MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). It allows us to send & receive various multimedia file types like images, audio, and video
within email messages. MIME is widely used by most email service providers & clients. 

MIME messages can be placed in headers that basically provide the information like, message, content, and body parts of the actual mail
