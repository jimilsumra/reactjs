What is Web Hosting?

Def: Web Hosting is the service that hosts the website and stores all the website-related files on a server. This can be
later accessible by the users on the internet.

For example, we have created a website on localhost & we would like to publish the site over the internet. At this stage,
we required web hosting providers to host our developed website. Once we upload the website content using FTP. After making it live
the site is available across the world for any users. 

There are different types of web hosting:
- Shared hosting (most common & reliable, where we share the space along with other website owners)
- Virtual Private server (VPS) hosting
