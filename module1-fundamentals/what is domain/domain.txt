What is Domain?

Def: Domain means the human-readable address to identify & access any website (for instance, google.com, www.xyz.com etc). The naming convention
of any domain can be anything but must not be the same domain name. Domain names are easier to remember than IP addresses (123.1.0.1)

For example, https://xyz.com/
