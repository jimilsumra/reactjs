What is IP address & IP config?

IP Address: IP address is a numerical representation of each device over the network to communicate over the internet. In simple terms,
the digital address of your device. It's useful to identify the device and ensure data is sent from one device to the
second device. IP addresses can also reveal your location that can be used by many marketing, & advertising companies. 

IP addresses can be masked by using the Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. VPN can be used to avoid exposing your original IP 
address. 

For example, 192.168.1.1

IP Config: IP config is a command line utility provided by Windows & other OS to display & configure TCP/IP network-related 
settings. 

We can configure all the below using "ipconfig" command:
- IP address,
- subnet masks,
- default gateways

For example, by applying the 'ipconfig' command, I can able to edit the below information:
